NOTE:It is confirmed to work on those consoles:

* Old 2DS
* Old 3DS (XL)
* New 3DS (XL)

If you use any other consoles, you will *probably* get an error. If it works for any other consoles besides those three (or five), [contact](https://idkwhereisthisname.github.io/contact) me.

NOTE2:Do NOT access data management, it will corrupt your DS saves and games.
