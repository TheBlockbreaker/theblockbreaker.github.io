Modifying your Twilight NAND can make DSi System Settings accessible from your 3DS

NOTE:It seems like it only works on: Old 2DS (the non foldable one), 3DS and 3DS XL, if you use any other systems, you will get an error

NOTE2:Do NOT access data management, it will corrupt your DS saves and games.
